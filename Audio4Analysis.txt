**No.** The sales call does not comply with several obligations outlined in Directive 2014/65/EU:

1. **Clear and Transparent Communication:**
   - The caller did not disclose the purpose of the call at the outset clearly. There was confusion about what the caller was asking and the purpose of the call.

2. **Provision of Comprehensive Information:**
   - The caller did not provide detailed information about the product or service. For instance, when asked about the "Information System" course, the response was vague ("I don't have the full details here").

3. **Recording of Communications:**
   - There was no mention of recording the call or informing the client that the conversation was being recorded.

4. **Client Protection Measures:**
   - There was no indication of performing a suitability or appropriateness assessment based on the customerâ€™s profile and requirements. The caller simply matched the client with schools without understanding his educational needs or goals.

5. **Customer Consent and Right to Withdraw:**
   - The caller did not obtain clear and explicit consent from the customer before finalizing the transaction or inform him of his right to withdraw from the agreement.

6. **Data Protection and Confidentiality:**
   - The call did not mention adherence to data protection laws or how the customer's data would be used or protected.

7. **Obligations on Pricing and Fees:**
   - No information was provided on costs, including tuition fees, any commissions, or additional charges.

8. **Handling Complaints:**
   - There was no information provided on how to submit complaints or the process for resolution.    

9. **Avoidance of High-Pressure Tactics:**
   - While not overtly aggressive, the call did not give the customer sufficient time to consider the offer or seek additional advice, rushing through the matching process.

These points indicate a lack of compliance with the outlined obligations, potentially leaving the customer misinformed, unprotected, and without clear avenues for recourse or understanding of their rights.
